# kobserve

The main objective of the kobserve sequence of "classes" is to teach developers/platform engineers about the full configuration and development (from infrastructure middleware to frontend code). After going through all the material cloud platform engineers will be able to help developers to configure in their applications the configurations needed to expose application observability and developers will be able to understand how to install, configure and use the tooling involved with observability team.

## Topics Structure

Those are the topics that will be covered across all "classes". The links for the videos will be shared here, as well as some instructions on how to reproduce each chapter will be under the appropriate topic in this document.

Most probably this structure will change, new topics will be added, other deprecated topics might be removed all together to avoid confusion.
